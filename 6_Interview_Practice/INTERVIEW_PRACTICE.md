# Interview Practice



#### The final phase of DS&A prep is technical interview practice. Backwards plan your prep from when you would ideally be practicing.

###### ***Note: You should not expect to ace practice interviews from your first attempt, so set yourself a realistic goal for each round.*** ######

#### After each interview, incorporate the feedback you received into an action plan of prep for your next round
