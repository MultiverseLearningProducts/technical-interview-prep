# Part 3: Common Problem Solving Patterns

## Study the following topics and try solving some *easy* level coding challenges. As you do take note of the following: 
- Concept
- Definition
- Significance
- Example
- Practice
- Resources


| Concept | Definition | Significance | Example | Practice | Resouces |

|         |         |         |         |         |         |

## Recursion

### Study the related topics and try some easy recursion problems.  Many problems (like factorial) can be solved both iteratively and recursively.

| Concept | Definition | Significance | Example | Practice | Resouces |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
|   Call Stack      |         |         |         |         |         |
|       Iteration  |         |         |         |         |         |
|    Recursion     |         |         |         |         | [Leetcode - Recursion Practice](https://leetcode.com/tag/recursion/)        |
|    Factorial     |         |         |         |         |  [Leetcode - Factorial Digit Sum](https://projecteuler.net/problem=20)       |
