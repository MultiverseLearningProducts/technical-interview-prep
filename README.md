| 1   | [Foundations](./1_Foundations/FOUNDATIONS.md) | The first step of DS&A prep is achieving fluency in the language you will interview in.|
| 2   | [Problem Solving](./2_Problem_Solving/PROBLEM_SOLVING.md) | Once you have fluency with the language, you need to understand how to analyze the efficieny / complexity of an algorithm |
| 3   | [Patterns](./3_Patterns/PATTERNS.md) | Next we look at common patterns for solving problems. |
| 4   | [Search and Sort](./4_%20Search_and_Sort/SEARCH_AND_SORT.md) | Study the topics and try some easy search problems.  Many problems can be solved with any search - the difference is in time complexity. |
| 5   | [Data Structures](./5_Data_Structures/DATA_STRUCTURES.md) | Study the topics and try some easy recursion problems.  Many problems can be solved both iteratively and recursively. |
| 6   | [Interview Practice](./6_Interview_Practice/INTERVIEW_PRACTICE.md) | The final phase of DS&A prep is technical interview practice. Backwards plan your prep from when you would ideally be practicing. |
