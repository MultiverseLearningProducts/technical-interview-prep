# Introducing the Technical Interview Prep Guide

## Overview

Welcome to the Technical Interview Prep Guide! This guide is designed to assist learners in navigating and upskilling their knowledge and practical skills through a series of coding challenges and technical interview preparations. Whether you're just starting your journey into the world of programming or looking to refine your skills for upcoming interviews, this guide is here to help you succeed.

# Table of Contents

| #   | Section             | Description                                   |
| --- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | [Foundations](./1_Foundations/FOUNDATIONS.md) | The first step of DS&A prep is achieving fluency in the language you will interview in.|
| 2   | [Problem Solving](./2_Problem_Solving/PROBLEM_SOLVING.md) | Once you have fluency with the language, you need to understand how to analyze the efficieny / complexity of an algorithm |
| 3   | [Patterns](./3_Patterns/PATTERNS.md) | Next we look at common patterns for solving problems. |
| 4   | [Search and Sort](./4_%20Search_and_Sort/SEARCH_AND_SORT.md) | Study the topics and try some easy search problems.  Many problems can be solved with any search - the difference is in time complexity. |
| 5   | [Data Structures](./5_Data_Structures/DATA_STRUCTURES.md) | Study the topics and try some easy recursion problems.  Many problems can be solved both iteratively and recursively. |
| 6   | [Interview Practice](./6_Interview_Practice/INTERVIEW_PRACTICE.md) | The final phase of DS&A prep is technical interview practice. Backwards plan your prep from when you would ideally be practicing. |

# Strategies For When You're Feeling Stuck

<br>

1. **Take a Break**
     - Sometimes, the best way to get unstuck is to step away from the problem. Do something unrelated to coding. Often, a fresh perspective can lead to a breakthrough.
2. **Ask for Help**
    - Don't be afraid to seek help from peers, mentors, or online communities. Describe your problem, share your thought process, and ask for guidance. 
3. **Break the Problem Down**
    - Complex problems can be overwhelming. Break them into smaller, manageable sub-problems. Solve each sub-problem individually and then combine the solutions.
4. **Review the Fundamentals**
    - If you're stuck on a problem that requires a specific data structure or algorithm, revisit the fundamentals. Review relevant concepts and examples to refresh your understanding.
5. **Practice Regularly and Learn from your Mistakes**
    - Consistent practice is key to building problem-solving skills. Set aside dedicated time each day to work on coding challenges, even if they're unrelated to your current hurdle.
