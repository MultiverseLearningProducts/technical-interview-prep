| #   | Section             | Description                                   |
| --- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | [Foundations](./1_Foundations/FOUNDATIONS.md) | The first step of DS&A prep is achieving fluency in the language you will interview in.|
| 2   | [Problem Solving](./2_Problem_Solving/PROBLEM_SOLVING.md) | Once you have fluency with the language, you need to understand how to analyze the efficieny / complexity of an algorithm |
| 3   | [Patterns](./3_Patterns/PATTERNS.md) | Next we look at common patterns for solving problems. |
| 4   | [Search and Sort](./4_%20Search_and_Sort/SEARCH_AND_SORT.md) | Study the topics and try some easy search problems.  Many problems can be solved with any search - the difference is in time complexity. |
| 5   | [Data Structures](./5_Data_Structures/DATA_STRUCTURES.md) | Study the topics and try some easy recursion problems.  Many problems can be solved both iteratively and recursively. |
| 6   | [Interview Practice](./6_Interview_Practice/INTERVIEW_PRACTICE.md) | The final phase of DS&A prep is technical interview practice. Backwards plan your prep from when you would ideally be practicing. |

# Best Practices

### Build a Strong Foundation:
<br>

- Start with the Basics: 
<br>
    - Ensure you have a solid understanding of programming fundamentals:
        - Variables
        - Loops
        - Conditionals
        - Functions
<br>
<br>
- Data Structures and Algorithms: 
    - Invest time in learning and mastering essential Data Structures such as:
        - Arrays
        - Linked Lists
        - Trees
        - Graphs 
    - Invest time in learning and mastering essential algorithms such as:
        - Sorting
        - Searching
        - Dynamic programming
    <br>
    <br>
    ***Work on also understanding their time and space complexities.***
<br>
<br>

### Practice Regularly:
- Be Consistent: 
    - Dedicate regular, consistent time to practice.
    - Daily practice is often more effective than sporadic cramming.

- Table of Content: 
    - Use the Table of Content above to navigate to a resource that best fits your needs.

- Leverage resources outside what is available above such as extra problem sets in: 
    - LeetCode
    - HackerRank
    - Code Wars
    
 ***Solve a variety of coding challenges on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or Codewars. Focus on different difficulty levels to build confidence***

 <br>
 <br>

### Learn from Mistakes:

- Debugging Skills: 
    - Use your mistakes as an opportunity to improve your debugging skills.
    - When you encounter errors, don't just look for solutions; understand why they occurred 

- Review Incorrect Solutions: 
    - After attempting a problem, review your solution thoroughly, even if it's incorrect. - Dry run your code on paper
- Use Python Visual Tutor:
    - Copy and Paste your code and [visualize your code](https://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit).
    - Step by Step, determine where your solution went wrong and how you can resolve it. 
- Reflect
    - Ensure that you reflect on the error you made, as mistakes tend to be our greatest lessons. 



# Strategies For When You're Feeling Stuck
1. Take a Break
     - Sometimes, the best way to get unstuck is to step away from the problem. Do something unrelated to coding. Often, a fresh perspective can lead to a breakthrough.
2. Ask for Help
    - Don't be afraid to seek help from peers, mentors, or online communities. Describe your problem, share your thought process, and ask for guidance. 
3. Break the Problem Down
    - Complex problems can be overwhelming. Break them into smaller, manageable sub-problems. Solve each sub-problem individually and then combine the solutions.
4. Review the Fundamentals
    - If you're stuck on a problem that requires a specific data structure or algorithm, revisit the fundamentals. Review relevant concepts and examples to refresh your understanding.
5. Practice Regularly and Learn from your Mistakes
    - Consistent practice is key to building problem-solving skills. Set aside dedicated time each day to work on coding challenges, even if they're unrelated to your current hurdle.
