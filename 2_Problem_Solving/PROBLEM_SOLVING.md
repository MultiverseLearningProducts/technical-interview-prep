# Problem Solving
#### How you approach problems is as important as your fluency with the language

#### I recommnend the SEAT method: Summarize the problem, develop Examples of inputs and outputs, Approach with the problem by breaking it down, and Test your approach to validate and optimize

Refer to these example problem prompts in order to get your started:

[Example Problem Prompts](./Problem_Solving_1.txt)

| Concept | Definition | Significance | Example | Practice | Resources |
| :-------: | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Summarize      |         |         |         |         |         |
|  Examples      |         |         |         |         |         |
|    Approach    |         |         |         |         |         |
|     Test    |         |         |         |         |         |
