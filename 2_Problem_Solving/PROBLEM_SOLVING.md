# Problem Solving
#### How you approach problems is as important as your fluency with the language

#### I recommnend the SEAT method: Summarize the problem, develop Examples of inputs and outputs, Approach with the problem by breaking it down, and Test your approach to validate and optimize

| Concept | Definition | Significance | Example | Practice | Resources |
| :-------: | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Summarize      |         |         |         |         |         |
|  Examples      |         |         |         |         |         |
|    Approach    |         |         |         |         |         |
|     Test    |         |         |         |         |         |
